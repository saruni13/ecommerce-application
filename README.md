# Overview
This project involved the containerization and deployment of a full-stack yolo application using Docker.


# Requirements
Install the docker engine here:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) 

## How to launch the application 
### Method 1 (faster)
- NOTE: This method does not require cloning of this repository

- Navigate to the launch_app folder and copy the contents of the [docker-compose.yaml] in the root of the project
- On your local machine, navigate to your desired directory and create
  a docker-compose.yaml file, paste the contents into it and save

  
  touch docker-compose.yaml
  

- Launch the application using docker compose up

  
  docker-compose up
  
- Terminate the application using docker compose down
  
    docker-compose down
  ### Method 2
- NOTE: This requires cloning of this whole repository

- Clone this repository to your local machine

  
  git clone https://github.com/bryanphilips/yolo.git
  

- Navigate to the root directory of your cloned repository

  cd yolo

- Launch the application using the docker-compose command

  
  docker-compose up
  

## Access the application on your browser using the following URL
 http://localhost:3000/

## How to stop the application
- Navigate back to your terminal and press "ctrl+c" 

## How to terminate the application completely
 
 docker-compose down


## The Docker images used in this application are sourced from this repository
(https://hub.docker.com/repositories/p801)

#### The backend repository on dockerhub

docker pull p801/yolo-backend-app:V5.1

#### The frontend repository on dockerhub
 
docker pull p801/yolo-app-frontend:V1.0

#### Copy the command below to find out the image size after successful docker pull

docker images

#### You should see something similar to this

# IP3 Configuration Management 

## Approach
I have cloned the github repository
 
        https://github.com/bryanphilips/yolo.git


### Security Improvements

#### hosts file
Created the hosts file with custom service hostname that can show mapping of the ip to a name then asign the name in the main.yml file 

#### update of the playbook.yml

The playbook.yml where we have  
  name: Copy hosts file      
      copy:   

        src: hosts

        dest: /etc/hosts

        owner: root

        group: root

        mode: "0644"

  In the mode: '0644' setting:

      0 - No special permissions  are set.

      6 - The owner of the file has read and write permissions (rw-).

      4 - The group has read-only permissions (r--).

      4 - Others have read-only permissions (r--).


So, 0644 means:

      Owner: Read and write

      Group: Read only

      Others: Read only
